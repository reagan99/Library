## 🌤️ Scene Characteristics

- **Architectural diversity:** combination of glass, stone, and concrete façades  
- **Dynamic lighting:** morning to late-afternoon captures with moving shadows  
- **Reflective materials:** large window façades and metal panels for specular effects  
- **Outdoor openness:** trees, paths, and plazas with wide-area continuity  
- **Realistic complexity:** natural lighting transitions ideal for photometric testing
